    "prompt": "A cinematic vertical photo-realistic image of an outdoor event scene in front of a stadium entrance. A light-skinned woman with vanilla blonde hair stands slightly far from the camera in full view, with visible legs. She wears a fitted black t-shirt and a short red skirt, and holds a large cardboard-style sign with both elegant hands. The sign clearly reads: 'I'm collecting money for concerts' (in bold, clean, handwritten lettering, no spelling errors). Above her, a large orange billboard dominates the upper third of the image with the white bold text: 'HELP THIS LADY'. The sky is bright blue with beautiful soft clouds, and the lighting is warm and natural, like early afternoon sun. The background is filled with a lively crowd of people going to a rock concert — dressed in dark clothes, band t-shirts, jeans, leather jackets, and boots. The stadium’s architecture is modern with visible white support beams and colorful concert banners.The woman's expression is confident and hopeful, and she wears large black-rimmed glasses. Color tones are vibrant but realistic with slightly soft contrast. The subject and billboard are in focus, with a shallow depth of field gently blurring the crowd to create depth.",
